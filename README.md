As a gator, plant and harvest crops while defending them from evil mobs! Planting crops cost money and harvesting crops rewards money.

Reach the next level by harvesting crops and reaching a money goal. There is a total of 9 levels, with freeplay following completion. Every new level reached grants an available upgrade that can be used for increasing speed or reach. Leveling up also unlocks new plants of greater value. Strategize your spending, as going bankrupt causes you to lose the game.

Foxes, wolves, and dragons will attempt to steal your crops. Fend them off by moving within range and holding down the mouse button for a particular amount of time. Foxes can be scared off in the shortest amount of time, while dragons are the most stubborn. As you level up, the difficulty will increase as more mobs will spawn.
